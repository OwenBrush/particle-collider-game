# Design Document

### Play the game:
- https://play.unity.com/mg/other/particle-collider

Project made as part of the Unity Junior Programmer course

### Given requirements:
- The prototype must count something.
- There must be a UI element displaying that count.

### Goals:
- Create a simple functional game in a short amount of time

### Mechanics:
- Player controls paddle that needs to catch oncoming spheres
- Game ends when timer runs out
- Catching spheres adds time to timer
- Spheres move inreasingly more erratically as time passes (or the timer accumilates/runs out?)

### Graphics:
- Primitive shapes and particle effects only (no assets used)
- black/yellow theme?

### UI:
- Simple title screen, single button to start
- Aesthetically interesting timer
- End of game displays time you lasted, then restarts

### Stretch goals:
- audio
- tutorial
