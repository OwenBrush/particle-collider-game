# Design Document

### Goals:
- Project made as part of the Unity Junior Programmer course
- Create a simple functional game in a short amount of time
- Incorporate the theme of counting in some way

### Mechanics:
- Player controls paddle that needs to catch oncoming spheres
- Games ends when timer runs out
- catching spheres adds time to timer
- Spheres move inreasingly more erratically as time passes (or the timer accumilates/runs out?)

### Graphics:
- Primitive shapes and particle effects only (no assets used)
- black/yellow theme?

### UI:
- Simple title screen, single button to start
- Aesthetically interesting timer
- End of game displays time you lasted, then restarts

### Stretch goals:
- audio
- tutorial
